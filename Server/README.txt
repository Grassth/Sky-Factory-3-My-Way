Welcome to Sky Factory 3 Server Guide

If you are looking for the guide for updating your server from an older version see UPDATE.txt

In this download you'll find two scripts one for Windows, Linux and Mac which will run the Forge Installer
to get the needed files for you! Like magic!

Hardware Notes:
	- Recommended Min Memory is 4GB (You can run it on 2GB but it's not ideal)
	- A modern processor/system which would be running the server.
	- Penguins would help make the server run faster if they run/waddle on the hardware itself.
		- Note: Please don't try that at home.

To get your server up and running just run the following:

- Windows:
	- Run Install.bat
- Linux & Mac:
	- Run Install.sh

Once the script finishes you'll be able to start your server. Please note the server does use a fair
amount of RAM is is taxing on the CPU; so please ensure you have a system capable to run a server.
Especially if you are planning to have a lot users on the server.

Don't forget you'll need to accept/create the EULA file for the server to start!
Also you'll find a `settings` file which you can edit the Java Options used for starting the server
make sure you edit the one for your system and that they are valid.

To start the server you can perform the following:

- Windows: (Only pick one of the options .bat file is prefered)
	- Run the Start.bat Script.
	- Double Click the Forge Jar.
- Linux & Mac:
	- Run the Start.sh Script.
	
You don't have to use the Start Scripts at all; if you know what you are doing by all means create your
own scripts to run the server. It's your server!
